            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Amatriciana is a traditional pasta sauce originating in Amatrice, a town in northern Lazio, 
            the same region in Italy where you'll find the Italian capital of Rome. Amatriciana is one of 
            the most popular and beloved pasta sauces in Italian (and Roman) cuisine.</p>
            <p>On its most basic level, <em>sugo all'amatriciana</em> features guanciale (cured pork cheek), tomato, 
            onion, and often chile pepper. Of course it's finished with a shower of pecorino Romano 
            cheese, which comes from the same region.</p>
            <h5>Ingredients</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>8 ounces (225 grams) guanciale <em>or pancetta finely diced</em></li>
                <li>½ cup finely chopped shallots <em>about 2 medium shallots</em></li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried thyme <em>or 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme</em></li>
                <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes <em>or less if you want it less <strong>spicy</strong></em></li>
                <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt divided, <em>plus more as needed</em></li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic cloves <em>about 3 cloves</em></li>
                <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
                <li>1 (28-ounce / 794-gram) can whole peeled San Marzano plum tomatoes <em>undrained</em></li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 pound (455 grams) rigatoni</li>
                <li>Grated pecorino Romano cheese <em>for serving</em></li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Steps</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. 
                    Add the guanciale or pancetta and cook until crispy, about 8 to 10 minutes. Use a slotted 
                    spoon to remove the crispy guanciale, leaving the rendered fat in the Dutch oven. 
                    Transfer guanciale to a small bowl and set aside.</li>
                <li>To the Dutch oven with the rendered fat, add the shallots, thyme, crushed red pepper, 
                    and ¼ teaspoon kosher salt. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring often, until the shallots 
                    are soft and translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, another 30 
                    seconds. Next, add the tomato paste and cook for another 30 to 60 seconds, stirring constantly 
                    to avoid scorching. Finally, stir in the canned undrained tomatoes.</li>
                <li>Remove from the heat, cover and place the Dutch oven into the preheated oven. Bake until the 
                    oil separates from the tomatoes, about 45 minutes. Use the back of a spoon or a potato masher 
                    to crush the tomatoes into a sauce. Add the crispy guanciale, black pepper, and the 
                    remaining ¼ teaspoon kosher salt and stir until incorporated.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot of salted water, cook the rigatoni until al dente. Use a slotted spoon 
                    or large skimmer to transfer the pasta directly into the sauce in the Dutch oven, reserving the 
                    pasta water. Place the Dutch oven over low heat and toss the pasta with the sauce. Add a splash 
                    or two of pasta water as needed to help loosen the sauce while stirring to coat the pasta evenly. 
                    Serve immediately, topped with grated pecorino Romano cheese.</li>
