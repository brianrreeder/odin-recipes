            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Ever since the Netflix show, “Chef's Table: Pizza” came out in the summer of 2022, 
                everybody's been wanting to make the pizzas seen in the different episodes, including me. 
                It's nice to change it up every once in awhile. You can't just eat pepperoni 
                and Margherita pizzas all the time.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>14 oz Pizza Dough for 14" pie</li>
                <li>½ cup Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
                <li>¼ Red Onion Sliced thin on a mandolin</li>
                <li>½ sprig Fresh Rosemary Leaves Chopped <em>Chris puts them on whole. I think they are better chopped.</em></li>
                <li>1 tbsp Pistachios Coarsely chopped</li>
                <li>½ tsp Kosher salt</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>I baked this in a conventional home oven. I have a pizza stone on the 
                    bottom rack, and a pizza steel on the top rack. The oven gets preheated 
                    to 525º F, and then holds for one hour before baking the pizza. 
                    (If your oven will go to 550º, do that.)</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the Parmigiano Reggiano over the dough</li>
                <li>Spread the red onions in a random order</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the chopped rosemary leaves and kosher salt</li>
                <li>Pistachios go on near the end, so leave off for now</li>
                <li>Bake at 525° F 8-9 minutes for 14", or 7-8 minutes for a 12" pizza. 
                Pull the pizza and top with pistachios for the last two minutes of baking. See notes below.</li>
                <li>Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil before slicing and serving</li>
            </ol>
